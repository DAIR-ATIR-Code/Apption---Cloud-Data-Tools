# Apption Boosterpack for DAIR
## Cloud Data Tools

The Apption Data Assessment Tool (A-DAT) is an open source project that provides a solution for:

* Bootstrapping data science projects and recognizing over 30 data types
* Uploading CSV files to any cloud SQL Server database (or local)
* Generating an optimized data schema
* Summarizing data fields and providing data quality metrics.



**A new folder (ServiceCatalogModel) containing a docker compose file has been added to this repo.** 
This signals a shift in the deployment style of this BoosterPack from the previous Morpheus-centric approach to an improved cloud-agnostic approach.
